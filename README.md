## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and model the demand for bike sharing in Seoul. The repository includes exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and supporting scripts and visualizations.

## Repository Structure

- **EDA_Mark.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset.
- **Predictive Modeling.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing predictive modeling workflows, including feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **EDA.html**: HTML export of the EDA notebook for easy viewing without running code.
- **helper_functions_shap.py**: Python script with helper functions, particularly for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value analysis and visualization.
- **SeoulBikeData.csv**: The main dataset used for analysis and modeling, containing Seoul bike sharing demand data.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies required to run the notebooks and scripts in this repository.
- **shap_values/**: Directory containing precomputed SHAP values or related outputs for model interpretability.
- **visualizations/**: Directory for storing generated plots, figures, and other visual outputs from the analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code to explore the analysis and modeling steps.
